## Topic
HbbTV enables the utilization of broadband delivered video, apps and further provides the basis for targeted advertising and content personalization along linear broadcast TV. Besides video advertising, display ads in the form of interactive banner, fullscreen overlays or even more enhanced formats are a very effective way to monetize content and increase user engagement via HbbTV. The scope is to implement display ad SDK allowing the integration of banner based ads with HbbTV applications.

For more information on running the components, please refer to the specific README.md file.
